* it starts like 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ..

### squares of numbers
* Write a function that takes a number as a parameter, then use a for loop to print the squares of numbers from 1 to the given number. 

## Nested for loop
### Multiplication table
- Write a nested loop that print the multiplication table for number from 1-5


## While loop
### odd numbers
* Write a function that takes a number as a parameter, then use a while to loop print odd numbers from 1 to the given number. 
### power of 2
